Spring Session aims to provide a common infrastructure for managing sessions. This provides many benefits including:

* Accessing a session from any environment (i.e. web, messaging infrastructure, etc)
* In a web environment
** Support for clustering in a vendor neutral way
** Pluggable strategy for determining the session id
** Easily keep the HttpSession alive when a WebSocket is active
